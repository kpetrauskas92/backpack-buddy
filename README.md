# User Experience (UX)

[Back to top](<#contents>)

## Wireframes

The wireframes for the website were produced in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com). The frames shown below have resolution of 1024px width on left and right side, as it looks the same on smaller devices. The final site varies slightly from the wireframes due to developments that occured during the creation process.

## Site Structure

The website has two pages only. The [home page](index.html) is the default loading page and has additional modals and alert boxes that appear when the user interacts with the website. [404](404.html) page is for when a user visits a page that does not exist and is presented with Error page.

## Design Choices

 * ### Typography
    The fonts chosen were 'Caveat' for the buttons and 'Nunito' for the body text. They fall back to sans-serif and cursive respectively. 
    *  'Caveat' was chosen for the buttons to give the user an adventure feel.
    *  'Nunito' is used for the body text as it goes along nicely with the rest of the font whilst being easy to read for all.

 * ### Colour Scheme
      The colour scheme eventually chosen is one based on green, lime green, black and brown. The colour contrasts with the main backpack image. Green traditionally gives the impression of nature and outdoors. Users visiting the website should sense the feeling of adventure.

### Future Features

- Print to PDF
  - A feature for Backpack Buddy would be a "print to PDF" function, which would allow users to easily save their backpack checklist as a PDF document. This feature would add convenience and flexibility to the user experience, enabling users to access their backpack checklist in a variety of formats and easily share it with others. A "print to PDF" function would be a valuable addition to Backpack Buddy, as it would make the backpack checklist more versatile and easier to use for a wider range of users.

- Weather Widget
  - Another future feature could be a live weather widget that displays the current weather conditions for a user's desired hiking location. This feature would enhance the user experience by providing users with up-to-date and relevant information about the weather conditions at their destination, allowing them to better plan their backpack contents and overall hiking experience.

- Native Android & IOS App
  - A final future feature could be to develop it into a native app for smartphones. This would enhance the user experience by providing users with a more convenient and accessible way to access their backpack checklist and other features while on-the-go. By developing Backpack Buddy into a native app, users could enjoy features such as push notifications, offline access, and faster loading times. This would make Backpack Buddy an even more useful and valuable tool for hikers, and would help to expand its user base by making it accessible to a wider range of users.

# Acknowledgements
The website was developed and designed as a Portfolio 2 Project for Full Stack Software Developer Diploma course at the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/). I want to give a big shoutout to my family for putting up with my coding-induced disappearances. You guys are the real MVPs for not sending out a search party every time I go down the rabbit hole of programming.

# Personal Note
I've often envisioned an app for hikers that goes beyond a simple to-do list. My idea is for an app that allows users to check the weather forecast a day in advance and provides all the features a hiker might need to prepare for any adventure. I'm considering building upon this website in the future and turning it into a native app for smartphones. I'm hoping that the upcoming modules in the Code Institute will equip me with the necessary tools to achieve this goal.
